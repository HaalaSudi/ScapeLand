        <p class="landArchintro2" >
            Painting almost exclusively in oils Stephen Brown is constantly drawn to painting subjects near his Devon home. Brown is a master at depicting the hazy warm Summer Days in the Devon, Wiltshire and more recently Gloucestershire fields. Stephen is also a tremendous Marine artist producing atmospheric paintings with the distinctive shimmering light of British beaches and coastal scenes.</p>
        <p class="landArchintro2" >
            But Stephen Brown is not limited to the British Isles. He has also traveled extensively producing superb contemporary paintings of Italy. He particularly likes Venice, Lake Garda and Tuscany where his understanding and application of light and colour have succeeded in some stunning paintings.</p>
        <p class="landArchintro2" >
            Stephen Brown has published numerous articles on oil painting for International Artist Magazines. He has also participated in the BBC production Art-The Big Event where Rolf Harris led a team of artists to paint a giant replica of Constable's The Hay Wain.
